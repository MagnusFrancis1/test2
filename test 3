Current world politics is witnessing the simultaneous growth and decline of
worldwide interconnectedness. On the one hand, continuing digital advances are
facilitating ever faster and more voluminous transfers of data. Climate change is
increasingly making itself felt across the globe, even in as remote a continent as
Antarctica. Some epidemics, as evidenced recently and dramatically by the spread
of COVID-19, develop into pandemics within a few months. On the other hand,
global foreign direct investment, a key measure of global financial flows, peaked
at US$2 trillion in 2015, falling significantly to US$1.5 trillion by 2019;1
 between
then and 2020, at least partly owing to the COVID-19 crisis, it fell by 42 per
cent. The ‘outlook remains weak’.2
 Authoritarian governments are increasingly
curbing cross-border communication, for example by forcing temporary internet
shutdowns or imposing permanent censorship on social media sites. Communities
beyond the nation-state, whether the EU, the ‘West’ or even ‘visions of world
community’,3
 are coming under severe pressure. Further examples of globalization and deglobalization processes could be offered almost indefinitely.
Until recently, an international institutional constellation often referred to as
the liberal international order has fostered globalization, adapted to its dynamics,
and attempted to keep major global political disturbances in check. This order,
however, is in trouble. In recent years, special issues on this topic have appeared in
many leading journals in the discipline of International Relations (IR), including
International Affairs and International Organization.

whether this order has the resilience to endure amid a rising number of rather
vocal agents turning against it. In recent years, anti-liberal forces have gained
more and more electoral support in countries as varied as the United States,
Brazil, India, Turkey and Hungary. Many of them, embarking on protectionist
policies and economic nationalism, have broken the supply chains that undergird economic globalization. Authoritarian rulers have strengthened their grip on
power at home and embarked on increasingly hard-nosed policies abroad. These
include China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, whose countries have
benefited from economic globalization, the former to a greater degree than the
latter. Liberal ideals of global governance could be brushed aside even more easily,
moreover, when their former chief defender, the United States, took the lead in
their destruction under the Trump administration.
The purpose of this special issue of International Affairs is to enquire into the
relationship between deglobalization and the strains on the liberal international
order. We examine three sets of questions. First, where do deglobalizing processes
come from? Do they originate outside the liberal international order? Or are
they, inter alia, produced by the liberal international order itself? Second, what
do deglobalizing dynamics do to the liberal international order? Does the order
remain resilient under pressure? Or does it weaken, perhaps even crumble? Third,
looking ahead, what are the plausible future scenarios for the international order
and how might they become actuality? Are deglobalization processes likely to
gain or lose momentum? Under what conditions will the liberal international
order be able to cope with these forces or even actively shape globalization and
deglobalization processes?
Tackling these questions, this special issue seeks to make three important contributions. First, it examines globalization and deglobalization systematically. While
economists and sociologists have already been debating deglobalization processes
for some time, IR scholars have been very reluctant to engage with them. Second,
we embed the liberal international order in broader globalization and deglobalization processes, thus opening up new pathways for research on the future of this
order. Third, the contributors provide novel insights into the forces that drive and
halt epochal changes in world politics.
The remainder of this introduction is organized into four sections. First, we
discuss globalization and deglobalization processes. Second, we identify past
linkages between these processes and the liberal international order. Third, we
move on to present linkages and what they have to do with the turbulent times in
which we live. Finally, we preview the contributions to this special issue.

Globalization and deglobalization
Globalization, needless to say, is difficult to define, and scholarship remains a long
way from any kind of consensual definition. Accordingly, we do not attempt here
to come up with yet another grand definition for either globalization or deglobalization. Rather, our more modest purpose is to establish a broad framework for
studying these phenomena.
Most definitions of globalization identify interconnectedness as a key characteristic. Actors increasingly connect, and socio-economic processes that used to
be more confined to more narrowly delineated geographical spaces such as the
state come to be more and more intertwined across wider areas. While there are
great variations in the extent to which locales within a state, states and international regions are plugged into global interconnectedness, that interconnectedness makes itself felt in one shape or another almost everywhere in the world
today.5
 This interconnectedness is multifaceted.6
 Take economic globalization,
for example. While it is only one dimension of globalization, it encompasses
the ‘integration of national economies into the international economy through
trade, direct foreign investment (by corporations and multinationals), short term
capital flows, international flows of workers and humanity in general, and flows
of technology’.7
 Yet globalization is not just about economics. From a medical
point of view, for instance, globalization is, among other things, the global spread
of microbes, including pathogenic viruses that cause diseases such as yellow fever,
influenza, AIDS and COVID-19. Social theorists, meanwhile, zoom in on the
remaking of geographical imaginations of socio-political space and communities.
In their reading, globalization decouples political communities from territorial
boundaries,8
 making the concept of global citizenship a possibility.9
Even during globalization’s heyday in the aftermath of the Cold War, however,
many authors cautioned that global politics was not all about increasing interconnectedness, and pointed to the existence of the opposite phenomenon. Giddens
juxtaposed globalization’s ‘action at distance’ to the revival of nationalism and
local identities,10 Robertson the ‘universalization of particularism’ to the ‘particularization of universalism’,11 and Appadurai homogenization to localization.12

Barber made the point in more colloquial language, suggesting that the planet was
‘coming together’ and ‘falling apart’ at the same time.13 ‘Glocalization’ remains a
key term used by many authors.14 More recently, Eriksen makes a similar point
when he writes about scaling up and scaling down.15 In short, many globalization
scholars argue that even when the balance tilts towards globalization processes,
there are also deglobalization processes occurring simultaneously.
Since the late 2000s, deglobalizing forces have become ever stronger. Some
authors, from economists to sociologists, are now even arguing that the balance has
tilted more towards deglobalization than globalization—or at least that it will do
so soon. O’Rourke and Williamson have jointly and separately published a series
of articles and books that juxtapose globalizing and deglobalizing epochs.16 They
start with the anti-global mercantilist restriction (1492–1820), continue with the
first global century (1820–1913) and the anti-global retreat (1913–50), and conclude
with the second global century (since 1950) and recent indications about a shift
towards another global retreat. The global financial crisis of 2007–2009 sparked
interest in peak finance and peak trade: that is, the question whether finance and
trade, after climaxing in the mid-2000s, would steadily decline thereafter.17 Van
Bergeijk makes an analogy between the Great Depression of the 1930s (‘deglobalization 1.0’) and the great recession of 2007–2009 (‘deglobalization 2.0’).18 Sociologists use the term in either analytical or normative fashion. For Hannerz, working
at the intersection of anthropology and sociology, deglobalization is underpinned
by cultural interpretations of Self versus Other.19 Walden puts a positive normative spin on deglobalization. He postulates a new world economy that is embedded
in society. Instead of being ruled by ‘the logic of corporate profitability’, it ensures
an equitable income distribution. There are no longer any transnational corporations or global organizations.20

Globalization, deglobalization and the liberal international order

International Affairs 97: 5, 2021
Globalization and the liberal international order
Globalization does not necessarily go hand in hand with a liberal international
order. What O’Rourke and Williams take to be the first global century was, of
course, hardly linked to any such order. The Concert of Europe originated, among
other contributory factors, as an attempt to quell domestic revolutionary forces
and curb the pressures they exerted on Europe’s monarchies at the time. At the
same time, European states tightened their colonialist grip on Africa and Asia.21
By contrast, the rise of the liberal international order since the end of the Second
World War happened in conjunction with the rise of globalization.
Free trade being a pillar of the liberal international order, this order has
fostered economic globalization, especially among western allies. This has been
underwritten by two cherished beliefs. The first is that free trade in goods and
services leaves everyone better off. The market is supposed to work a considerable
amount of magic. There have been plenty of scholarly contributions about how to
regulate the global market,22 but post-Cold War global politics has moved in the
opposite direction. The so-called ‘Washington Consensus’ promoted a neo-liberal
economic agenda around the world. Attempts to curb such an agenda, for example
through the Global Compact, the Millennium Development Goals and then the
Sustainable Development Goals have, for the most part, not been legally binding
and leave plenty of room for different interpretations. The second belief is that
economic interdependence produces peace among states. Increasing economic
interconnectedness makes waging war increasingly costly; therefore—as first
suggested by Montesquieu—going to war becomes less and less compatible with
means–ends calculations.23 In IR, the ‘commercial peace’ hypothesis has been
discussed from a great variety of angles.24 Underpinned by these two beliefs, an
unprecedented economic globalization occurred, especially in finance and trade.25
Democratization is something else that the liberal international order has
purported to do irrespective of where a state is located on the globe. Democracy
is expected to produce internal and external restraints on the use and abuse of
power, which is held to be critical for the behaviour of democratic states towards
fellow democracies.26 Democracies are very unlikely to fight one another, as the

‘democratic peace’ hypothesis puts it.27 The more the liberal international order
evolved over time, the more democracy came to surpass other forms of government as the sole legitimate kind of rule. The 1970 UN Friendly Relations Declaration, for example, stated that ‘every State has an inalienable right to choose
its political, economic, social and cultural systems’ (UNGA 2625 (XXV)). Such
formulations have become increasingly rare since the 1990s, and not only in
documents emanating from the UN. The African Union, for instance, strongly
endorsed democratization in its 2007 African Charter on Democracy, Elections
and Governance.
Finally, the liberal international order postulated more and more global governance in a growing number of issue areas.28 These range from development to
health, from environment to migration, and from science and technology to
human rights—the last of these, being at the core of justificatory discourses on
the liberal international order, serving as an engine of global governance. By the
1990s, the human rights field had come to exert considerable influence even in the
international security realm. New rules were added to international humanitarian
law, the International Criminal Court was created to enforce them, the Responsibility to Protect made it into the World Summit Declaration and from there
into Security Council resolutions, and arms control treaties such as the bans on
landmines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons followed the human-centred
logic of international humanitarian law. All of these changes, although accompanied by plenty of contestation (especially by Great Powers), came to be formally
institutionalized.
Whither globalization? Whither the liberal international order?
More recently, the liberal international order has been shaken not only by a failure
to steer certain globalizing forces in the intended directions, but also by the rise of
deglobalization processes that buffet the pillars upon which it rests.
Economic globalization made for major economic growth rates but the liberal
international order, staying aloof of distributing wealth more equally, contributed
to making its own opponents. The global export volume of trade in goods, which
stood at US$3.495 trillion in 1990, had jumped to US$19.45 trillion by 2018. Global
GDP grew from US$84.149 trillion in 2009 to US$142 trillion in 2019.29 The richest

International Affairs 97: 5, 2021
economies account for two-thirds of this figure.30 Within these states, however,
the distribution of wealth remains extremely skewed, and the gap between rich and
poor is increasing.31 Populism is linked to distributional inequalities and discontent
among certain sections of electorates, as for example in America’s midwestern
and southern states, who have lost faith in the ability of the liberal elite to offer
them much economic hope.32 It is very unclear whether the unequal distribution
of wealth will be meaningfully addressed any time soon. Technological advances,
especially in the digital realm, improve the quality of life of people around the
world but also decrease the importance of labour as a factor of production, as does
the rise of low-paying service industry work at the cost of traditionally secure jobs.
On top of all this, the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 introduced in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic are further widening the gap between rich and poor.
With economic globalization slowing down significantly in recent years, a new
set of problems awaits the liberal international order. The sharp decrease in foreign
direct investment, for instance, is likely to have severe repercussions. It is expected
almost to halve investment flows to Africa, Asia and Latin America.33 Contrary to
hopes of fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals, millions of people could
be thrown back to poverty. While the number of refugees is already at a record
high, significantly more people could join the global refugee surge. Societal unrest
and more authoritarian tendencies in host states could be the result. Whether the
global governance mechanisms set up by the liberal international order when it
was still going strong will be able to handle these challenges is doubtful. We will
revisit this issue in greater depth below.
As for democratization, the times when scholars celebrated the latest wave
of these processes have, for the time being at least, passed.34 There is plenty of
‘democratic recession’. Freedom House reports that 2020 was the 15th consecutive
year of decline in freedom worldwide. In 2020, democratic recession was particularly pronounced: ‘Nearly 75 percent of the world’s population lived in a country
that faced deterioration last year.’ In sum, ‘democracy’s defenders sustained heavy
new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international
balance in favor of tyranny’.35 Scholars have shifted their attention to another
global trend, labelled democratic backsliding or authoritarianization.36 Numerous

states, including China and Russia, have moved towards more authoritarianism in
recent years. It is also important to remember that democracies do not necessarily
generate liberal and democratically oriented leaders. The unequal distributional
effects of economic globalization have played into the hands of populist leaders
in states otherwise as different as, say, Brazil, Hungary and the United States.
More and more illiberal leaders put additional pressures on the liberal international order and, in the case of those whose policies are about withdrawing into
the nation-state and cutting global interconnectedness, add to deglobalization
dynamics. This, in turn, feeds back into the interplay of economic globalization
and the liberal international order, and also has severe repercussions for global
governance.
While some globalizing forces continue to make themselves very much felt, the
liberal international order’s capacities to channel these forces in desired directions
is decreasing markedly. Record numbers of refugees do not prompt states to meet
somewhere in the middle to address the situation adequately. Although climate
change is becoming increasingly obvious even without consulting complex scientific models, with exponential global warming accompanied by rising sea levels
and catastrophic floods and fires, effective attempts to counter it remain elusive.
Human rights field has become a major diplomatic battleground, especially at
the UN Human Rights Council, and is no longer a field that exports ideas for
governance in other fields. On the contrary, indeed, institutions built at the intersection of, say, the human rights and security fields—for example, the International Criminal Court—are coming under severe pressure, or even being rendered
defunct, such as the principle of the Responsibility to Protect. Perhaps the decline
of global governance capacities has been most visible in attempts to co-manage the
COVID-19 crisis. During the early phase of the crisis, China made only late and
piecemeal reports to the World Health Organization (WHO). As a result, there
was a fateful delay in determining a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern. Even after this point, Chinese cooperation with WHO, for example
to determine the origins of the virus, has remained all too limited. Needless to
say, the US decision to leave the WHO, an already strained organization, in the
midst of a major global crisis, did not help the search for effective responses.37 Joe
Biden’s narrow victory in the 2020 US presidential election has raised hopes that
the United States may abandon some of his predecessor’s policies, yet America’s
‘economic retreat’ predates the Trump administration and may not be fully or
easily redressed.38 The post-pandemic world economic order may reinforce and
institutionalize some of the economic deglobalization policies that leading states,

Globalization, deglobalization and the liberal international order
1313
International Affairs 97: 5, 2021
Taken together, the evolutionary patterns of (de)globalization and the liberal
international order will have major implications for peaceful change in world
politics. Globalization and the liberal international order, for all their faults, made
it possible for new powers to rise peacefully. This applies especially to China and,
to a limited extent, India and Brazil, along with many middle-income countries
in the G20 grouping. Globalization placed them in an advantageous position
to produce and market goods and services more cheaply by providing multinational corporations with platforms and outsourcing labour, especially technical
personnel. With its cheap labour and aggressive trade practices, China has built the
world’s supply chains in a majority of consumer goods, propelling its economy
to a size four times that of 1989. This is an unprecedented development: most
previous rising powers had to fight their way to a correspondingly prominent
status, and many failed in the attempt. Economic discrimination has been a major
source of their reluctance to initiate system-changing wars.
The power transition process among the major powers could become more
conflictual.39 China is already flexing its muscles around the world, while Russia
is becoming more aggressive towards its neighbours with the intent of reestablishing its sphere of influence. It remains to be seen whether liberal states,
once rallying around the United States to nurture and protect the liberal order,
will be able to do so again under President Biden. The Trump legacy of antagonizing longstanding allies, undermining America’s role as protector of the liberal
international order and damaging its reputation for making credible commitments, may weigh heavily. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, connecting its market
with Asia, Europe and Latin America, has resurrected the fears of a new form
of hegemony built on the principles of tianxia (‘all under heaven’, denoting the
tributary system). In recent times, China has increased its military adventurism in
the South China Sea by building artificial islands and claiming huge swathes of
territory, pitting it directly against the ASEAN states,40 as well as stoking military
crises with Taiwan, Japan and India. The suggestion by Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the foreign ministry, that China may choose to engage in ‘wolf warrior
diplomacy’,41 may very well be compatible with this assertiveness.
Organization of the special issue
This special issue is organized into three clusters of contributions. In the first,
authors enquire into the agents of globalization and deglobalization processes.
They examine how hegemons, Great Powers, middle powers and networks, coping

with the pushes and pulls of globalization and deglobalization, foster and undermine the liberal international order, and how this, in turn, feeds back into globalization and deglobalization. Ripsman puts strong emphasis on the ability of Great
Powers to shape international order.42 He argues that while their relations changed
significantly under pressure from post-Cold War globalizing forces, current tensions
are not primarily a cause of deglobalization. Critically discussing the widespread
assumption that orders change when challengers to a hegemon arise, Chan maps
the transformation of the United States into a revisionist power.43 He pays close
attention to domestic politics in making this contention. Miller, focusing on the
core states of the liberal international order, analyses the ways in which domestic
politics leaves a mark on international politics and vice versa.44 He contends that
states’ fostering of liberal policies abroad has, over the long term, undermined their
liberalism at home. Aydin moves away from the focus on Great Powers and zooms
in on middle powers.45 She shows that many of these second-tier states are also
experiencing an illiberal turn, thereby adding to the instability of the liberal international order. Finally, Geva and Santos analyse the rise of right-wing anti-globalist networks.46 They make a case that these networks need not challenge
globalization per se but certainly undermine the liberal international order.
Second, several contributions address international institutions in great depth.
Owen does so from a historical perspective.47 Discussing the evolution of liberalism from the eighteenth century to the present, he distinguishes different interpretations of liberalism and their manifestations in the evolving international
order. He argues that current contestation among three versions of liberalism
undermines the liberal international order. He endorses a dialogue between these
different versions, leading to a better adaptation of the current liberal international order. Some of these adaptations—reduced capital mobility and reduced
migration—would slow down globalizing forces. While Owen provides a historically sensitive account of (ideas for an) international order, Bátora discusses how
the current international order is composed.48 He provides a nuanced account
that alludes to different fields (or sub-orders) of this order and, equally important,
the relations among them. Using the concept of interstices, he traces the ways in
which new institutional forms, always bearing the imprints of previous forms,
arise in these borderlands between fields. It is these interstices, he contends, that
are of crucial importance for transformations of world order.

Globalization, deglobalization and the liberal international order

International Affairs 97: 5, 2021
The third section features articles that scrutinize functional fields of the world
order. Coleman and Job contend that the UN’s liberal peacekeeping practices are
coming under pressure as non-liberal states and regional organizations get more
and more involved with peacekeeping, including its funding.49 Hayes and Weber
caution that current deglobalizing forces put human security under threat.50 Some
long-time advocates of this lens, having turned inward-looking and neglecting
their roles as shapers of order, have abandoned it. Lobell and Ernstsen analyse
how economic nationalists arise out of opposition to globalization and how they
then work towards deglobalization.51 The authors compare the workings of these
mechanisms in the late eighteenth century and since 1970. Brawley examines how
financial globalization has created and coped with a series of crises.52 He argues
that recoveries have tended to be partial, generated new inequalities and therefore
not made for more stability in the long run. Moving to trade, Sinha diagnoses a
new global North–South divide.53 Emerging powers often back existing trade
rules that foster globalization, whereas major powers in the North, some losing
from these rules, are increasingly turning against them and towards deglobalization. Kornprobst and Strobl discuss how past shifts towards more globalization
have made it easier for certain communicable and non-communicable diseases
to spread, and the generation by these shifts of instruments to cope with such
spread that are often all too weak and introduced only after the passage of considerable amounts of time.54 On the basis of these historical patterns, the authors
discuss future scenarios for how COVID-19 is likely to affect today’s international
order. Money investigates migration, distinguishing different regimes within the
field.55 She argues that while certain globalizing forces will persist, the field of
refugee movement is likely to experience significant pressures. Behera, analysing
knowledge production, cautions against an epistemic colonialism that is inherent
in the globalization of knowledge production.56 She argues that while there are
currently tendencies towards a deglobalizing epistemic parochialism, there are
also opportunities to move to an epistemic pluralism instead.
Paul concludes this special issue. Discussing and linking the major themes
raised by the other contributors, he makes a case for keeping deglobalizing forces

in check and re-adapting liberal order to the twenty-first century.57 Paul advocates
a reformed welfare state to deal with the domestic crises of liberal states, especially
those arising from widening income inequalities, which are the main cause of
the weakening of the liberal order internationally. In so doing, his contribution
links domestic and international politics, and offers both theoretical insights and
practical ideas for scholars and policy-makers alike.
